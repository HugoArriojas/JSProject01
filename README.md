# Emergency Preparedness Quiz

The emergency preparedness quiz was one of my first JavaScript apps where the user is quizzed on various aspects on emergency preparedness.
The page is supposed to respond and change according to the user's answers depending if they are correct or incorrect.

As this was one of my first projects, there needs to be an increased focus on accessibility and there are multiple edge cases to be fixed especially with different screen sizes
